# üõ∞Ô∏è Space X Launch Success Prediction Capstone

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of the full Data Science lifecycle, from data acquisition and preparation through to advanced machine learning modeling, focusing on the prediction of Space X Falcon 9 launch success outcomes.

The goal was to build a robust classification model to predict the final outcome (success or failure) of a launch based on pre-flight parameters and historical data.

## üéØ Project Goal

Deploy a set of classification models capable of predicting the binary outcome of Space X launches with high accuracy, minimizing risk and optimizing future mission planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Data Science Workflow

This capstone was executed using an end-to-end pipeline, showcasing proficiency in all stages of a complex data science challenge:

1. **Data Acquisition & Sourcing**
   - **API Collection:** Acquired real-time and historical launch data directly from the official Space X REST API using Python's `requests` library.
   - **Web Scraping:** Utilized advanced web scraping techniques to supplement API data with specific launch details not available in the structured API output.

2. **Data Wrangling & Cleaning (SQL & Pandas)**
   - Extensive data cleaning, handling missing values, standardizing categorical data, and transforming raw JSON into relational format.
   - **SQL EDA:** Used complex SQL queries to structure data, perform initial exploratory analysis, and identify correlations and feature relationships.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**
   - Conducted thorough univariate and bivariate analysis to identify key predictors of launch success.
   - Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for static visualizations and **Folium** for interactive maps of launch sites.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling (Prediction)**
   - Trained and evaluated four classification algorithms:
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
